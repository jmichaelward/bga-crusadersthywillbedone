# Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done

A board game by Seth Jaffee, published by Tasty Minstrel Games.

## About

It's 2021. The global coronavirus pandemic rages on, and I miss spending time sitting across from
a tabletop playing board games with my friends. Last year, I subscribed to Board Game Arena, where I
thankfully got to play some automated versions of some of my favorite games: Teotihuacan, La Granja,
Troyes, Terra Mystica, etc.

Board Game Arena has a developer program, and as you can see in this repository, all of their games
are written using traditional web languages: PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and CSS. I know those languages! 
What I don't know, however, is how to make a web adaptation of a board game, or how to extend a framework
(such as BGA's) that isn't open-source for all to view.

With nothing else to do this year, I thought this might be the time I learn how. Hence, this project.

Someone else has already started an implementation of Crusaders, but that project was last updated in
July of 2020. Since I think it's easier to learn something starting from scratch rather than trying to
pick up where someone left off (at least as far as unfamiliar platforms are concerned), I figured I'd start
my own. Maybe this will get published and put the site; maybe it won't. What's important to me at this
point in time is to learn how everything works, so I can continue to build additional games in the future.

Thus, an experiment begins, in public, for all to see. Enjoy!
